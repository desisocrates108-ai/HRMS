# Servall Hiring OS - PRD (Updated Feb 13, 2026)

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI, Frontend: React + Shadcn UI, DB: MongoDB, AI: GPT-5.2, Auth: JWT Bearer
- WhatsApp: 11za API (real httpx dispatch, fire-and-forget)
- Public feedback: tokenized single-use links (no auth needed)

## Feb 13, 2026 — Iteration 22 (latest) — Designation-based Hiring module

**Breaking change to data model + UX:**
- Designations now carry `office_type` (`head_office` | `franchise`). Legacy rows auto-backfilled at boot. DB unique index migrated from `name_lower_1` → compound `(name_lower, office_type)` so same name can exist across both office types.
- Lead model adds `designation_id`, `min_salary`, `max_salary`, `description`. Creating/updating a lead with `designation_id` auto-fills `job_role` from the designation name and sets `is_technician` from its `office_type`.
- Add Lead form (both HO and Franchise) now has **Designation* / Min Salary / Max Salary / Description** in place of the removed Job dropdown.
- **Jobs module soft-removed**: sidebar entry replaced with **Hirings**; `/jobs` route redirects to `/hirings`. All Jobs data preserved in DB. Existing `job_id` linkage on leads still resolves for backward compatibility.

**New Hirings module (`/hirings`):**
- Two tabs (Head Office | Franchise) — each lists every designation of that office_type as a card.
- Each card shows total + 8-stage breakdown: New, Qualified, **Interview Scheduled** (hr_interview), **Interview Completed** (manager_interview), Hold, Selected, Joined (three_months merged in), Rejected.
- Click card → `/hirings/{segment}/designations/{id}` candidate listing (Name, Mobile, Email, Applied date, Stage badge, View → opens existing Lead Detail page).
- Legacy leads (`job_role` string, no `designation_id`) still match by case-insensitive name; ad-hoc unknown roles show with a "Legacy" badge.

## Feb 13, 2026 — Iteration 17 (previous)
- **Open Positions widget — stage breakdown + active-only count**: Backend `get_open_positions` now filters applicants to pre-selection stages only (`new_lead`, `qualified`, `hr_interview`, `manager_interview`, `hold`) — anyone at `selected` / `three_months` / `joined` / `rejected` is excluded. Each row now carries `stage_breakdown` (per-stage counts) which the dashboard renders as colour-coded pills (e.g. "New: 2", "HR: 1").
- **Editable Role on Lead Detail (every stage)**: Lead Detail badge is clickable at all stages. New "Assign Role / Change" dialog (`lead-job-role-dialog`) fetches jobs filtered by the candidate's segment (HO vs Franchise) and PUTs `{job_id}` to `/api/leads/{id}`. Empty selection unassigns. `LeadUpdate.job_id` added; empty-string handled as `$unset`. Update response is now enriched with fresh `job_role`.

## Feb 13, 2026 — Iteration 16
- **Job Designation on Leads**: `/api/leads` and `/api/leads/{id}` enriched with `job_role`. Pipeline cards show role (slate-600 medium) or "Role not specified" (italic grey). Lead Detail page shows prominent blue badge below name (`data-testid=lead-job-role-badge`).
- **Open Positions Dashboard Widget**: New card under Lead Split on CEO + HR dashboards with two columns (Head Office | Franchise). Format: "Role — N openings — M applicants". Openings = count of open jobs grouped by role; applicants = leads linked to those jobs, respecting dashboard date filter (`date_from`/`date_to`/`days`).
- **Employee Code Manual Entry**: Removed auto-generation in the create API. `EmployeeCreate.employee_code` is now required (Pydantic). Returns 409 on duplicate (create + update). `EmployeeUpdate.employee_code` added; empty string rejected with 400. Unique partial index on `employees.employee_code` (idempotent). Add Employee dialog and Edit drawer both expose a required text input with client-side validation; backend error surfaced via toast.

## Role Hierarchy
- SUPER (full access): CEO, HR
- MANAGER: Marketing/Operations/Sales/Accounts Manager (+ Franchise Manager allowed for interviews)
- EXECUTOR: Sr HR, Jr HR, Marketing Coordinator, Graphic Designer, Franchise Executive

## Pipeline Model (Feb 2026 restructure — three_months stage added)

### Head Office
`new_lead → qualified → hr_interview → manager_interview → selected → three_months → joined`

### Franchise (Technician)
`new_lead → qualified → hr_interview → selected → three_months → joined`

Parallel states: `hold` (resumable, requires hold_reason), `rejected` (terminal, triggers WhatsApp feedback).

### Stage Transitions
- HR interview → Manager interview requires HR questionnaire submitted + manager_id field.
- Selected requires prior interview round.
- `three_months` auto-saves `three_months_start_date` + `three_months_due_date` (now+90d) AND dispatches WhatsApp Offer Letter + creates `offer_letters` DB record.
- Hold → Selected (or any forward stage) now works (Feb 2026 bug fix).
- Hold pop-up requires mandatory reason.
